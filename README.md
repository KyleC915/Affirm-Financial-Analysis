# Affirm vs Klarna -Financial-Analysis

Project Title: Affirm vs Klarna Financial Performance & Growth Analysis
We will be analyzing the past three fiscal years (FY 2020 to FY 2022).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps: 
1) Retrieve historical financial statements.
2) Clean and organize the data. 
3) Analyze financial performance and stock growth.
4) Find correlation between the financial performance and stock growth metrics.
5) Visualize the data with Tableau.
6) Draw conclusions.

Walkthrough:
1) I used Excel's Power Query and extracted all historical financial statements from Affirm's Annual Reports and Klarna's Annual Reports.  (PDF and Excel is located in 'FinancialStatements' folder).
2) Cleaned the data through Excel, SQL was not needed since there were little number of rows and columns, fixed titles and removed null values.
**NOTE: When extracting the data, the words in column 1 did not space out correctly. We can fix this in our visualization in Tableau.**
3) Converted Klarna's Financial Statements to USD from SEKm. (Klarna is based out of Sweden).
4) To make it easier to find material changes in the financial statements I created a common sizing % and % change column for each FY. This will make it easier to depict what is important for our visualizations.
