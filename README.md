Project Title: Affirm Annual Financial Performance vs Growth Analysis
We will be analyzing the past three fiscal years (FY 2020 to FY 2022) with the FYE date of 6/30.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps: 
1) Retrieve historical financial statements.
2) Clean and organize the data. 
3) Analyze financial performance and stock growth.
4) Find correlation between the financial performance and stock growth metrics.
5) Visualize the data with Tableau.
6) Draw conclusions.

Walkthrough:
1) I used Excel's Power Query and extracted all historical financial statements from WSJ for the company, Affirm, and removed the 5-year trendline column in the process. (Files can be found in the directory 'UncleanedData').
2) Then, I manually removed all null rows (I.E Inventory) as the company holds no inventory in every fiscal year ('FY').
3) I wanted to make it easier to find material changes within the financial statements to visualize later in Tableau. Therefore, I created a common sizing and % change column for each FY. (Find cleaned and organized data in the directory 'CleanedData').
4)
