Steps: 
1) Retrieve historical financial statements.
2) Clean and organize the data. 
3) Analyze financial performance and stock growth.
4) Find correlation between the financial performance and stock growth metrics.
5) Visualize the data with Tableau.
6) Draw conclusions.

Walkthrough:
1) I used Excel's Power Query and extracted all historical financial statements from Affirm's Annual Reports.  (PDF and Excel is located in 'FinancialStatements' folder).
2) Cleaned the data through Excel, SQL was not needed since there were few number of rows and columns, fixed titles and removed null values.
**NOTE: When extracting the data, the words in column 1 did not space out correctly for Affirm. We can fix this in our visualization in Tableau.**
3) To make it easier to find material changes in the financial statements I created a common sizing % and % change column for each FY. This helps analyze what changed significantly.

Analysis:
1) Please see Financial Analysis in Tableau.
2) The buttons redirect you to the respective dashboard on the top of the dashboard.
